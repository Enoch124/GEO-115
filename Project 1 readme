GEO 115 PROJECT 1

Project Overview
This project is a simple Python-based Student Management System designed for the GEO115: Programming in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) course. It demonstrates the use of basic Python constructs, including functions, dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements.
The program allows users to:
-	Add student names and their scores
-	View the score of a specific student
-	Calculate and display the class average, maximum score, and minimum score
-	Exit the program

Features
1.	Add Student: Users can input a student's name and their corresponding score.
2.	View Student: Users can retrieve and display the score of a particular student by name.
3.	Calculate Class Average: The program calculates the average score of all students, as well as the highest and lowest scores in the class.
4.	Exit: The program continues running until the user opts to exit.

How to Run the Program
Prerequisites
1.	Python 3: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine 
2.	IDE: You can run the script in any IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.).
3.	Git: To clone the repository, Git should be installed. 



Steps to Run
1.	Input the code into the IDE 
2.	Run the Python Script
3.	Interact with the Program:
 
  
Program Menu
Upon running, the program will display the following options:
1.	Add student
2.	View student
3.	Calculate class average
4.	Exit

-	Option 1: Enter a student's name and score.
-	Option 2: Retrieve a student's score by name.
-	Option 3: Calculate the class average, highest score, and lowest score.
-	Option 4: Exit the program.

Error Handling
- The program handles invalid inputs, such as entering non-numeric values for scores or selecting menu options outside the available range.
- If no students are added, the program will notify the user when attempting to calculate averages.
